# HAL-Policy-for-Incident-Response
Guidance for how each branch will respond to suspected incidents within HAL Organizations on Corporate owned systems & Networks.
Corporate owned systems are any system operating in a HAL production environment on the company network, whether within the company owned facilities or issued to company agents or employees for use at remote locations for company business.
This policy seeks to minimize systems and networks disruption introduced by unauthorized activity and intrusions.
It is management’s intent that improved communication and coordination be used to improve organizational response and mitigates damage from successful intrusions. 

SCOPE
This policy applies to all HAL employees and affiliates at all HAL facilities and locations world-wide

Ownership
This policy is under the direct control of the Corporate CIO with input from the CISO & other members of management with an interest in the program
HAL Incident Response Planning Team (IRPT) made up of CISO & Reps from each Div & Regional office Implements the policy.
IRPT meet routinely as scheduled to review & approve policy & procedure changes.
Modification changes or requests are approved using a simple vocie vote with majority consensus prevailing.
CIO & CISO each have the ability to veto any modification request.
CISO serves as IRPT Liaison to CMPT (Contingency Planning Mgt Team)

TERMINOLOGIES
Event - an activity or action within HAL systems or networks
Adverse Event – an event with the potential to negatively impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information stored, processed or transmitted through HAL systems or networks. 
Incident – An adverse event that has occurred, and actively threatens the security of information within HAL systems or networks. 
Intrusion – a penetration of HAL’s systems or networks by a threat.  For HAL purposes the term incident will be used instead.  
Disaster – an incident which has escalated to the point where it threatens the continuity of operations of an entire branch, rather than just the security of information on HALs systems or networks. 
IR - Incident Report / Information Request
CSIRT -  Computer Security Incident Response Teams


HAL will use the CERT incident response methodology(IRM)

A number of sources of information could indicate the presence of an incident as an adverse event in HAL’s systems or networks.
Once an adverse event is reported, triage (assessment by a member of the CSIRT) will determine whether the adverse event is an actual incident.  
In the event it is determined to be an incident, the CSIRT assesses the severity and scope of the incident, and begins recording their initial findings using the HAL IR form. 
The Team works to contain the incident as specified in the IR procedures documents;
Once the incident has been contained, all systems recovered, and the vulnerability allowing the incident remediated, the CSIRT submits the IR form summarizing their findings, resolutions, and recommendations for changes to the IR procedures. 
 
 Regional/Divisional Incident Response Planning Team Liaison 
 Each HAL Region or Division will appoint two team members as representatives to the corporate IRPT. 
 These representatives may not include the Regional Manager (SECCDC Team Leader). 
 It is strongly urged that both designated liaisons be identified and properly trained and kept current with ongoing issues. 
 
Change Management Documentation 
All modifications to HALs systems in response to a documented incident are pre-approved under the provisions of the Emergency Change (Change Type 2) as per the Change Management Policy and Procedures.
CSIRTs must coordinate with the regional Change Control Officer to ensure the proper documentation is completed and reported. 

IR Closure Reporting 
Unless specified by the IR Procedure document, the CSIRT must resolve and report all incidents within three (3) hours of detection or risk administrative actions. 
Complete and submit the IR Form, following all steps as outlined in the HAL IR Procedure

Incident to Disaster Escalation 
The IR liaison to the Corporate IRPT will assess the incident during the response stage and determine whether the incident constitutes a real and present danger to the ongoing operations of the branch, based on the ability of the CSIRT to contain the incident. 
The liaison will notify the HAL CISO immediately should the team be unable to contain the incident. 
The CISO will make the final determination as to whether the incident has escalated to a disaster and will assign additional resources and make appropriate notifications as needed. 

Enforcement 
Any employee found to be in violation this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
